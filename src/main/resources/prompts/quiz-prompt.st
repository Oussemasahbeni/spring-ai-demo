Take a deep breath and work on this problem step by step, Generate new {numberOfQuestions} questions with a maximum of 4 options, for evaluating a certain skill:
- Imagine that you are building a quiz generator for a platform that helps people prepare for technical interviews (The questions must have some hard questions).
- Use this Github repository as a source of data: https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes/blob/main/spring-framework/spring-framework-quiz.md
- The quiz should be personalized for an individual with the following background:
        - Educations: {educations}
        - Professional Experiences: {experiences}
        - Projects: {projects}
- The quiz should contain questions of varying difficulty levels and Ensure that questions cover a wide range of concepts.
- The distribution of difficulty levels should be as follows:
        - 30% of the questions should be easy
        - 40% of the questions should be medium
        - 30% of the questions should be hard
        - The quiz should contain a mix of questions from different categories.

        - How to achieve this result questions
        - Multiple choice questions
        - Questions
- Ensure that questions cover a wide range of concepts related to the skill being evaluated, such as algorithmic problem-solving, data structures, coding best practices, system design, etc.
- skill : {skill}
- The response should be an object
- The object will have only one field called questions
- The questions field is a list of questions, each question should have the following fields:
        - question: the question text
        - options: an array of json objects, each object should have the following fields:
                - answer: the answer text
                - correct: a boolean value indicating if the answer is correct or not
        - time: the time needed for the question in seconds
